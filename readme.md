# Welcome
This was made to provide a quick start template for those who reallt are not wanting to play with express a lot.

It uses Nodemon to launch a live development server with a delay of 5 seconds.

# Adding pages

Go to `config.js` then pages then add your page path to the list, for example:
 - 
 ```nodejs
 ["page1","folder/page 2","folder/page 3"]
 ```

# Do I need to reload?
nope - nodemon automatically does it for you.
